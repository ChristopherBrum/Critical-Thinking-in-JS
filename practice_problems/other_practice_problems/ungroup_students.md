# Ungroup Students

```js
/*
You volunteered to help out teaching a preschool in your area! You were given an array of all students and some important data about them, grouped by their teacher. Create a function that will ungroup every student so you can look at their details individually.

----------------------------

Input: 1 array of objects
- each object has two properties
  - a teacher property 
  - and a data property containing an array of objects
    - each object represents a students and some information about them

Output: 1 array of objects
  - each object will combine the teacher and each individual students information

Rules:
- take an array of objects as an argument and reorganize it so that 
  - each individual student has a
    - teacher property
    - name property
    - and other property specific to the student

DS:
- iterateion will be used to construct a new array of objects

Algo:
- decalre a new array object (newStudents)
- iterate through the array of objects
  - iterate through the current objects properties
    - iterate through the data property array
      - push a new object to newStudents with 
        - the outer objects teacher property
        - each property of the inner object
- return newStudents
