Problem:
Explicit Rules:
- write a function that takes one string as an argument
- the function should perform sentiment analysis on the given test
- it will determine whether the given text is positive, neutral, or negative based on the number of positive or negative words in the text
- positive and negative words given as arrays

Implicit Rules:
- the function will output a message that shows
  - the number of positive words
  - the positive words used
  - the number of negative words
  - the negative words used
  - the sentiment of the given text

DS:
Input: A string
Output: A series of console outputs
Intermediate:
- splitting the given text into an array of words (?)
- using RegEx to match positive/negative words
- booleans for comparisons

Goal: Create a function that takes a body of text as an argument, identify the positive and negative words used and determine the sentiment of the text

Abstractions:
- iteration to collect all positive and negative words

Algo:
- declare positives and negatives variables to empty arrays
- split the given text into an array of strings delimited by whitespace
- iterate through the array
  - if the current word is in the positive words arrays, add to positive
  - if the current word is in the negative words arrays, add to negative

// - declare positiveMatches and negativeMatches variables to empty arrays
// - iterate over the length of the positive and negative words arrays
//   - find all matches of the current element from the positive words array
//     - push the matches to the positives array
//   - find all matches of the current element from the negative words array
//     - push the matches to the negatives array

- log the positive words total (array length)
- log the individual and unique positive words
- log the negative words total (array length)
- log the individual and unique negative words
- subtract the length of the negative matches from positive matches
- log whether the texts sentiment is pos, neg, or neutral
